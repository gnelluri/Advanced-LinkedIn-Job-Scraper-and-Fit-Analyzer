# Advanced-LinkedIn-Job-Scraper-and-Fit-Analyzer
This sophisticated Java-based application scrapes job listings from LinkedIn, analyzes their fit based on user-defined criteria, and provides actionable insights.

Leveraging Playwright for efficient, stealthy web scraping, it extracts job details (title, company, location, description) from LinkedInâ€™s dynamic job pages. Instead of basic keyword matching, it employs BERT-based NLP (via Hugging Face Transformers) to compute semantic similarity between job descriptions and a user-specified set of positive keywords (e.g., "Java," "Spring," "SQL"), while penalizing blacklist terms (e.g., "senior," "manager") for a nuanced match percentage.

Job data is stored persistently in an SQLite database for historical analysis and exported to an Excel file named with the current date (e.g., Jobs_2025-03-20.xlsx), featuring a widened, text-wrapped "Description" column and a "Match Percentage" column. A JFreeChart bar graph visualizes match scores, offering an intuitive overview of job fit. The system runs automatically via a ScheduledExecutorService, scraping daily and sending email notifications (using SendGrid) for jobs exceeding a 70% match threshold. This end-to-end solution combines cutting-edge scraping, AI-driven analysis, and user-friendly outputs to streamline job hunting.
